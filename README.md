# E-Commerce Customers Segmentation Dashboard

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard and an Unsupervised Machine Learning model designed for analyzing e-commerce transactions and customer segmentation. The dashboard provides insights into transaction trends, customer demographics, coupon usage, and merchant performance, while the machine learning model enhances customer segmentation using clustering techniques.

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- **Total Transactions & Customers**: Overview of key business metrics.
- **Customer Segmentation by Gender**: Distribution of male and female customers.
- **Burned Coupons Analysis**: Breakdown of used coupons by city.
- **Top Merchants by Transactions**: Identifying high-performing merchants.
- **Trends & Status Overview**: Monthly and quarterly transaction trends with `burned` vs. `subscribed` status.

## 🤖 Unsupervised Machine Learning Model

In addition to the Power BI dashboard, this repository includes an **Unsupervised Machine Learning Model** to enhance customer segmentation through clustering. This model identifies distinct customer groups based on transaction behavior and other relevant features, allowing for better business insights and targeted marketing strategies.

### 🔍 Model Details

- **Algorithm Used**: DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise).
- **Purpose**: Automatically segment customers based on behavioral patterns.
- **Silhouette Score**: 0.8659897621542652
- **File**: `E_Commerce_Customer_Clustering.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with the machine learning implementation.
- **How to Use**:
  1. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
  2. Run the cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and analyze the results.
  3. Review the identified customer clusters and their characteristics.
